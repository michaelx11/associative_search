Hi and welcome to Associative Search. This service takes a list of words and attempts
to find a single association that best fits the group. Go ahead and click "Two Stage Demo" then "Run Query"
to see an example in action.

The basic usage is:

1) Provide comma-separated search terms
2) Choose stages to execute with (explained below)
3) Provide flavortext for scoring (or don't)
4) Run Query (and wait up to 2 mins or so)

Stages:
- Wiki Sub-Articles (Stemmed) tries to find Wikipedia Articles that contain references to your search terms.
"Stemmed" means we break the article names into stems and search those instead of exact matches.
- Wiki Sub-Articles (Exact) does the same but with exact title matches
- Wiki Sub-Items (Stemmed) does a similar search but includes list items and table items, it can get a little messy
but broadens the search significantly.
- Synonym - Expands search set by synonyms of current search set. Be careful using this after a Wiki step!
- Homophone - Expands search set by homophones of current search set. Also be careful with this (less so than Synonym)

You can stack these stages to broaden your search. For example, no single article on Wikipedia contains all films.
However, there is an article that contains links to 'Films that start with letter X'. In this case you can do a 
two stage search to find out if all your search terms are parts of some film title!
